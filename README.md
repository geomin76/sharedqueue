# sharedqueue

An web/mobile app where Spotify users (and hopefully Apple Music users) can add to a shared queue and share music together!

Building with Spring + Java for backend and TBD for front end

### Notes
---
- For test_frontend, run node app.js, open up `intro.html`. 
- Go through the auth from Spotify, and if sucessful, you will be redirected to `works.html`. 
- Inside `index.html`, you can call `http://localhost:3000/token` to access your token and get Spotify content. 

I will continue to build a "test" front-end to build functionality to the shared queue system.
